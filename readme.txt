Talk.bat
By Addison Djatschenko.

This program allows people with access to the folder to message each other:
In a standalone program (Talk.bat)
In two programs, one of which is a live feed (Live Feed.bat and Message.bat)
By editing the message file in a text editor (messages.txt)
Or, to send messages while another program is open, to make a new file, write a message, and click Ctrl+S (make file 'message.txt')
